# STM32-Avionics
# Author: Will Armentrout

The goal of this Repo was to complete sensor, STM32 Hardware Integration, telemetry display testing in preparation for creating a Custom Avionics PCB using the STM32 framework.
This Repo is broken into groups.
- Datasheets (where all the sensor and microcontroller datasheets are stored)
- Pinouts and Schematics (Where all Nucleo and sensor pinout/schematics are stored)
- Sensor Testing (Testbed folder for primative code to access sensor data and run servos)
- Telemetry and UI (Computer Side code for processing incoming sensor data from the microcontroller and displaying it to the user)

Let me know if there are any questions/recommendations! I am not a Computer Scientist/Engineer. I'm just a Mechanical Engineer looking to create more cool stuff.
